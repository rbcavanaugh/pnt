### pnt: Computer adaptive forms of the Philadelphia Naming Test

An R package and web-app for administering the Computer Adaptive
Philadelphia Naming Test (PNT-CAT).

**[PNT-CAT Technical documentation](https://rbcavanaugh.github.io/pnt)**

### About

This application allows clinician users to administer adaptive (PNT-CAT)
and static versions of the Philadelphia Naming Test ([Roach et al.,
1996](https://mrri.org/philadelphia-naming-test/) and generate output
that provides scores on a common T-score metric, where the expected mean
and standard deviation of persons with aphasia are 50 and 10,
respectively. Users have the option of downloading performance data and
a pdf-report of the results. Please note that the app does not store any
data beyond a single user-session.

Comments, feedback, and bug reports are encouraged. Please submit as an
issue: <https://github.com/rbcavanaugh/pnt/issues>.

### Installing & Using the application

There are a number of ways to use the application (see below). However,
please note that server resources are finite, and therefore **we ask
that researchers use option 2 for the following reasons:** (1) The
version of the app remains consistent throughout the research study
(option 1, 3, and 4 may change based on any updates to the app), (2)
There is an inactive time-out limitation on the free online version of
the app to keep server costs reasonable, which means that a long break
(\>15 minutes) without activity may cause you to lose your current
session. (3) Both the free online version and `shiny::runGithub()`
function require a stable internet connection and data will be lost if
an internet connection is lost.

**Detailed installation instructions can be found here:
<https://github.com/rbcavanaugh/pnt/wiki>**

#### 1. Online

The app is now online at <https://william-hula.shinyapps.io/pnt-cat/>

#### 2. Local Installation

The app can be installed locally via `remotes::install_github()`

#### 3. Local installation on RStudio Cloud

The app can be installed and run from RStudio Cloud
(<https://rstudio.cloud/>) if R/Rstudio canâ€™t be installed locally.

#### 4. Remote access to the app, run locally

The app can also be accessed via `shiny::runGitHub()`

#### 5. Clone the repository

If desired, the repository can be cloned, and run locally.

    git clone https://github.com/rbcavanaugh/pnt.git
