# pnt: Computer adaptive forms of the Philadelphia Naming Test
<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->

This application allows clinician users to administer adaptive (PNT-CAT) and static versions of the Philadelphia Naming Test ([Roach et al., 1996](http://aphasiology.pitt.edu/215/1/24-09.pdf)) and generate output that provides scores on a common T-score metric, where the expected mean and standard deviation of persons with aphasia are 50 and 10, respectively. 

Specifically, the web-app allows clinicians to:

1. Administer a 30-item PNT-CAT, 175-item PNT-CAT, two static 30-item PNT short-forms, 175-item Standard PNT. 
2. Re-administer a 30-item PNT-CAT, variable-length PNT-CAT, or alternate PNT short-form to assess change in naming ability
3. Upload a scores from an offline PNT to obtain a naming ability estimate and associated credible interval. 

For each option, users have the option of downloading performance data and a pdf-report of the results. Please note that the app does not store any data beyond a single user-session. 

For users looking for a deeper dive into principles of item-response theory and computer adaptive testing in aphasia, we recommend:
