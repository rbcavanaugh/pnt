\description{
This function is the core of the computer adaptive functionality. It takes a data
frame of all the current items, and whether or not the current test is adaptive (IRT)
whether or not the user has elected to exclude previous items, what those items were,
whether or not the user elected to exclude eskimo, and whether the test is a 30-item static short 
form.
}
\details{
First, it creates a vector of all of the completed items in the current test
Then adds any items from a previous test if there was one. 
Then uses the current test responses to generate an ability estimate, sem, and the next item
How these are generated depends on the current test (adaptive or not, 175 or not, walker or not)
}
