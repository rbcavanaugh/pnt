</h3>
<p>One obstacle to using IRT models for clinical assessment is that the
relationship between the responses and the resulting score estimate is
more complicated than with number-correct or percent-correct scoring.
However, many clinical assessments in speech-language pathology
appropriately rely on norm-referenced scores that are typically
constructed by scaling number correct scores to the mean and standard
deviation of a relatively large sample from the population of interest.
That approach is available in an IRT framework as well and we have
chosen to scale the score estimates such that they have a mean of 50 and
standard deviation of 10 in the calibration sample. Of note, while
norm-referenced scores are often non-linearly transformed to approximate
a normal distribution, we have not done so in the current application,
even though the distribution of scores in the calibration sample is
negatively skewed. We made this choice because such a transformation
would have further complicated the relationship between item difficulty,
person ability, and the expected score or predicted response. As such,
users of this application should be aware that although a T-score of 50
represents the estimated mean score for persons with aphasia and a score
of 60 indicates a score that is one standard deviation above the mean,
these scores do not correspond to the percentile ranks associated with
these values in a normal score distribution. However, the differences
are relatively small: The T-score at the 50th percentile (median) of the
calibration sample was 51.9, and a score of 60 is at the 87th
percentile, whereas it would be expected to fall at the 84th percentile
if the scores were normally distributed.</p>
<p>A second obstacle to using IRT models in clinical assessment is that
they rely on relatively strong assumptions about the data and the nature
of the underlying construct being assessed. One such assumption is that
the items included in the assessment respond to a single underlying
construct or dimension. In the present context, application of the 1-PL
IRT model requires the explicit assumption that the ability to name
common objects can be represented by a single dimension, trait, or
ability. Thus, use of the present application, and for that matter any
total score metric for a naming assessment, ignores the well-supported
view that naming ability in aphasia can be impaired along multiple
dimensions, e.g., semantics, lexical selection, and phonology. More
complicated models are required to measure abilities that are expressed
along multiple dimensions (e.g., Walker et al., 2018) and such models
are more challenging to apply to adaptive testing. While the use of a
unidimensional model for the PNT is an oversimplification of reality, it
is a useful simplification that is well established in the field of
clinical aphasiology.</p>
<p>A third obstacle to the implementation of IRT in clinical assessment
is that they require relatively large amounts of data (i.e., large study
samples) to support testing of model assumptions, validation of model
predictions, and robust estimation of item parameters. Fortunately, the
Moss Aphasia Psycholinguistics Project Database (Mirman et al., 2010)
provided an excellent foundation for the line of research that has led
to the present PNT-CAT application.</p>
<p>A fourth issue concerns a specific limitation of the current PNT-CAT
application. A computer adaptive test requires a calibrated item bank
from which items can be selected for administration. In the current
context, an item bank is a set of items that have been shown to respond
to a single underlying trait or ability (i.e., is unidimensional) and
that have been located on a common metric or scale. In the 1-PL IRT
model, locating items on a common scale involves estimating their
difficulty relative to one another and to the sample of individuals
providing the response data, a process referred to as calibration. One
issue for the present PNT-CAT application is that the item bank is
limited to the 175 items in the full PNT. To function optimally, a CAT
requires a large number of items distributed across the full range of
difficulty. While the PNT item bank contains a relatively large number
of items in the lower-middle range of the difficulty/ability scale
(approximately between 40 and 55 on the T-score scale), and it has
somewhat fewer items at the lower end of the spectrum below 40 that can
be targeted to individuals with severe anomia and very few items at the
upper end of the scale that can be administered to individuals with very
mild anomia. Practically, this means that if a person with severe anomia
is being given the PNT-CAT30 and has responded incorrectly to the 10
easiest items in the PNT (e.g., <em>‘cat’</em>, <em>‘key’</em>,
<em>‘eye’</em>. <em>‘bed’</em>, <em>‘ear’</em>, <em>‘nose’</em>,
<em>‘baby’</em>, <em>‘hand’</em>, <em>‘hat’</em>, and <em>‘tree’</em>),
it becomes increasingly unlikely that they will get each subsequent item
correct, and each new item provides progressively less information.
Likewise, when a person with mild aphasia has responded correctly to the
10 hardest items (<em>‘stethoscope’</em>, <em>‘microscope’</em>,
<em>‘pyramid’</em>, <em>‘binoculars’</em>, <em>‘volcano’</em>,
<em>‘ambulance’</em>, <em>‘dinosaur’</em>, <em>‘cheerleaders’</em>,
<em>‘thermometer’</em>, and <em>‘slippers’</em>), it becomes
increasingly likely that they will get each subsequent item correct and
continuing to administer additional items provides progressively
decreasing information. At the same time, it should be noted that
persons with aphasia commonly experience substantial moment-to-moment
variability in their naming behavior, and unexpected correct and
incorrect responses can and do occur at rates that are somewhat greater
than predicted by the 1-PL model (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=EbZ3n5cAAAAJ&amp;sortby=pubdate&amp;citation_for_view=EbZ3n5cAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C" class="external-link">Fergadiotis
et al., 2015</a>; Huston, 2021). Despite this variability, we have found
that the PNT-CAT30 produces scores that are highly correlated with the
full PNT (<em>r</em> = 0.95; <a href="https://pubs.asha.org/doi/abs/10.1044/2018_JSLHR-L-18-0344" class="external-link">Fergadiotis,
Hula, Swiderski, Lei, Kellough, 2019</a>) and that the agreement between
the PNT-CAT30 and PNT-CATVL is also high (<em>r</em> = 0.89; <a href="https://pubs.asha.org/doi/abs/10.1044/2019_JSLHR-L-19-0213" class="external-link">Hula,
Fergadiotis, Swiderski, Silkes, and Kellough, 2019</a>).</p>
