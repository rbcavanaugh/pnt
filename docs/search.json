Regarding item-person targeting, intuitively apparent group persons severe aphasia given test composed entirely easy--name items, ‘cat’, ‘ear’, ‘bed’, ‘hat’, ‘tree’, scores vary meaningfully possible rank order terms number name correctly. hand, group individuals severe aphasia given test composed difficult--name items, ‘microscope’, ‘stethoscope’, ‘pyramid’, ‘binoculars’, ‘volcano’, likely receive minimum score rank ordering terms number correct possible.
